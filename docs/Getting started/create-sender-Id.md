# Create sender ID

Before utilizing the **HudumaSMS API**, please ensure that you have created a **sender ID** in our system. This **sender ID** will be necessary for sending messages through the API. Make sure to have created your preferred sender ID in the HudumaSMS platform before integrating it into your application. And your sender ID must be approved before starting to use it.

- `Go to the hudumasms.com plaform`
- `After Signing  go on the left side menu` â†’ `click sender-Id`
- `Click create sender-Id button to create new sender Id` 

## Default sender ID

If you haven't yet received approval for your requested sender ID, you can still start using **INFO** or  **HUDUMASMS** as the default sender ID in the meantime. This allows you to begin sending messages through the HudumaSMS API while your custom sender ID is being reviewed and approved.
